# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to detect fraudulent transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset.

## 🎯 Objective
Identify and classify fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning techniques.

## ⚙️ Methodology
- 📊 **Dataset:** `creditcard.csv` (contains anonymized features and class labels)
- 🧩 **Preprocessing:**
  - Checked for null values and handled class imbalance
  - Visualized fraud vs genuine transactions
- 🧠 **Model:** Logistic Regression
- 📈 **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

## 🧮 Results
- Achieved strong accuracy in classifying transactions as **fraud** or **non-fraud**.
- Demonstrated effective baseline performance for imbalanced datasets.
- Insights gained into fraudulent behavior patterns.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python · Pandas · NumPy · Scikit-learn · Matplotlib · Seaborn
